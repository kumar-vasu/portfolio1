            <p>In this project we attempt abatement of fake news on social media. This project was also my thesis topic. There were some criterions that needed to be met for any possible solution of this problem. First and foremost, The solution needed to safe gaurd freedom of speech, We can't just make another way to censor people and call it a day. The solutions needs to focus on the recipient of fake news. All we wanted was for people to be able to make a more educated decision when it comes to being influenced by online news. To accomplish this we prepared an online platform. This platform enabled news agencies to form a distributed consensus regarding the factual background of any news. We focused on the fact only because fact remains constant even if truth is now considered to be subjective in this age. The distributed system was made possible using a blockchain architecture and the agencies contributing to the verifiction would get exclusive rights to the news. Blockchain also helps with safe gaurding the information. As mutation of information after it has been deemed fake or real could cause confusion. We developed an algorithm according to which any new news was channeled to the conserved authorithy for retrieval of proof. We further implemented bert to perform multi class classification of news so that proof need not be retrieved for the same kind of information again and again.</p>
            <p>In order to measure how much abatement was being made we had to simulate the spread of news in population using spread model. But modern day scenerio witnesses biased spread due to amlicious spreaders and our application would also behave as such relentlessly spreading the information. To deal with such scenerios we formed a new spread model which we called SSIR spread model. the results are provided in the attached image.</p>
